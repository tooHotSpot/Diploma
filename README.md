# Siamese SENet for One-shot Image Recognition

This model is based on two papers:

- Siamese Neural Networks for One-Shot Image Recognition, full thesis: [Koch, Gregory R.. "Siamese Neural Networks for One-Shot Image Recognition" (2015)](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gkoch/files/msc-thesis.pdf) and [ICML 2015 Accepted paper](https://8109f4a4-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/deeplearning2015/37.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cqodJWpc2owyZOfCtRTKrHGHfKJpXdleCjnJrg8252A5h519LlJ_5Y9NtBdPi3vjvO1Uiow0IuEGott8Mue1JATcPoTHAiONkSXdnciSIigBhNoqqManDSyer-m35rSw5oxvO5r7leMb3MCWZsnTVowjSAd7Llm9u8vjVOVERLvUyXqHgjklznsVwKbcu9sWTsIGnu3zPHLjTuXDaSSVfMqA-3O8Q%3D%3D&attredirects=1)
- [Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Hu_Squeeze-and-Excitation_Networks_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf)

Aim is to gain better accuracy with modern SENet architecture, with same training pipeline as in 1-st paper.
